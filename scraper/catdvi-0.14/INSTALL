This file describes how to build and install CatDVI version 0.14.


REQUIREMENTS:

  * a hosted ISO C (1990) environment

  * the kpathsea library (installed) and accompanying header files

  * only when building from CVS (if you don't know what that means then
    you aren't): GNU autoconf

Attention:
  * For GNU/Linux users: with most distributions, it is not enough to have
    TeX installed; the kpathsea headers are usually contained in an extra
    package called "libkpathsea-dev" or "tetex-devel" or similar.

  * For teTeX users: there were (are?) some teTeX pre-built binary tarballs
    with statically linked libkpathsea in existence that did (do?) not include
    the necessary development files. These will not work.

  * Cross compiling catdvi does not work at the moment.


IF YOU HAVE GNU MAKE AND A POSIX SHELL ENVIRONMENT:

This is the easiest way. Note you need _GNU_ make. Really.

  * Only when building from CVS:
    	autoconf

  * On systems where "make" is GNU make (e.g. Linux):
	./configure [options]
	make
	make install

  * On systems where "make" is not GNU make, but GNU make is available under
    a different name (e.g. *BSD). The customary name is then "gmake".
    Assuming this name:
	MAKE=gmake ./configure [options]
	gmake
	gmake install

The options to configure are standard. Type
    ./configure --help
for a list.


OTHERWISE:

A simple bourne shell script "build.sh" is included in the distribution tarball.
Edit to your needs and run. Then install the resulting catdvi executable and
(perhaps) the catdvi.1 man page to appropriate places.

Even if you don't have a bourne shell compatible /bin/sh, it is fairly easy
to understand what the script does and to adapt it to your environment or
execute the necessary steps manually.
