0.14 - More powerful layout algorithm with enhanced vertical positioning
       capabilities and better handling of sub- and superscripts in
       mathematical formulae.
     - New font encodings: all AMS fonts except the cyrillic ones.
     - Completed Blackboard font encoding.
     - Brought in line with Unicode 3.2.
     - Fixed false out of memory errors on some systems (e.g. AIX 4.2).
     - Several small fixes and improvements.

0.13 - New font encoding `LaTeX symbols'.
     - Three new font encodings offering the European currency symbol:
         + Henrik Theilings European currency symbol (`eurosym') font
         + TS1, the encoding of the TeX text companion fonts
         + Martin Vogels symbol (`MarVoSym') font
     - New output encoding ISO-8859-15, which offers the Euro symbol.
     - The --output-encoding option now accepts descriptive names (but still
       understands encoding numbers as well).
     - Some bug fixes.

0.12 - Page range selectable by command line options.
     - Improved OML, OMS, OMX and Cork input font encodings.
     - Try to diplay hanging glyphs (e.g. operators and radicals) at the
       visually correct position. Improves math.
     - Translate more Unicode glyphs to available equivalents for ASCII and
       ISO-8859-1 output encodings.
     - New, more flexible output encoding handler gets width of ligatures
       right.
     - Building without GNU make should be easier now.
     - Some bug fixes and speedups.
     - Fixed building on FreeBSD (and maybe other systems).

0.11 - Sequential processing option
     - New font encoding: TeX Typewriter Text
     - New, much better alignment algorithm
     - Some bug fixes.

0.10 - Added a manual page.
     - More build system tweaks (no more missing glyph warnings for
       regular builds)

0.9 - More build system development. Should now be up for debianization.

0.8 - Improved build system (uses autoconf)

0.7 - Bug fix: dimension scaling was fucked up

0.6 - New option --copyright.

    - Remove option -v; leave --version.

    - Use private space to map characters that are not in Unicode,
      such as SS, NG and ng.

    - Added the test/ subirectory.

    - Added a partially filled translation table for Blackboard encoding

    - Wrote a lite version of the new layout algorithm.

    - TFM file parsing code is now almost finished


0.5 - Bug fixes:
        * catdvi.c (main): Mention -d in the --help output
        * outenc.c (oen_tbl): Add the missing comma between 
          the ASCII and Latin-1 entries.
        * GNUmakefile (distclean, maintainer-clean): Include
          enc/*.h files in the distribution.


0.4 - Output routines for US-ASCII and ISO 8859-1

    - Easy way to generate font encoding translation tables from DVIPS
      .enc files.

    - Translation tables for the Cork encoding and most of Knuth's font encodings,
      with occasional unknown glyph.

    - Option parsing.  (Current options: -dehv)

    - Font encoding is now found by reading the TFM; the TFM file is
      found with help from kpathsea.

    - New build system.


0.3 - Use Unicode internally

    - output Unicode

    - translate OT1 to Unicode
